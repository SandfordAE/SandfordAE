### Greetings ....  Welcome to SandfordAE

Unfortunatly a lot of the repos are private as I primarily use Github for testing workflows with Github actions ect.
and as such the apps I use here would primarily be for testing puposes only,  
With that said some of the more reusable pieces (nothing fancy) I've made public.  
If you would like access to any of the private repos then please feel free to get in touch to request an API key.
